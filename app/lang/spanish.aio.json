AIO also contains an original version of each file just in case any of the backup files are missing. In future versions I plan to include an option to copy and store your own system's backup files into AIO as a failsafe to ensure compatability for future CMD versions.\n - In general, for all Compatible CMD versions it is safe to run uninstalls of tweaks that have not been installed BUT keep in mind that AIO will overwrite the files involved with the included failsafe backups because it will not find any available backups in the system.  So try to avoid running uninstallers for tweaks that you have not installed.","t2":"What Parts Of The System Are Not Reverted By AIO?","msg2":"#### **MZD-AIO-TI modifies some files in the system that cannot be reverted back using this app.** \n\nThese first 3 files honestly should never be reverted because a mistake in one of these files will result in a unrecoverable bootloop.

This occurs when a file or directory cannot be modified becasue it is open or being used by another program. While compiling, close all folders and documents especially files that are actively being used by MZD-AIO-TI (*ex: '_copy_to_usb'*)\n - Try selcting fewer tweaks at a time, picking too many increases the chaces for an unexpected error. \n - If the installer does not start in the car try reformatting your USB drive as FAT32 and make sure all other USB devices are disconnected. It helps to turn bluetooth off too.
