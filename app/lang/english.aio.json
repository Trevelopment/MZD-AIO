He went on to develop a CMD based program to accomplish this and it worked well but had reached certain limitations and lacked that modern app feel.  I contacted Siutsch and proposed we make the next AIO desktop app style starting with the same tweaks from AIO v1.5.x that we all know and love. I went on to develop MZD-AIO-TI. \n\n##### I personallty tested all the tweaks in my 2016 Mazda3 FW:55.00.753A-NA\n\n##### I can offer no warranty but I did include every safety precaution I know about.\n\n###### **So please, be mindful when performing tweak installs.**  \n\nThis app will automatically update.\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Click the CMU-Autorun link above and download the repository (download button is on the top right next to \"<span class='icon-search4'></span>Find File\").  Copy the \"installer\" Folder to a blank USB drive to install the autorun script, this script will run every time the system boots up.   The script looks at the root of the SD card (if available) for a file called \"run.sh\" and if found, executes the file. After installing, copy the \"dryrun\" folder onto an SD card to test that the installation worked correctly. </p><p>AA - Copy the contents of the \"headunit\" folder to the root of a blank SD card, connect before booting up infotanment system, a message will show the first time to confirm it is running.  \nPlug in an Android Auto compatible phone to start.</p><p><b>Caveats:</b> The device with the headunit files must be connected before booting up the infotainment system to run. Once the headunit app is running it is loaded into memory and will silently run in the background, this means that even if you remove the SD card the headunit app will still be running in memory.  To stop the process you can do one of these things: <ol><li>Turn off the vehicle for about 5-10 minutes</li><li>Hard reset (hold: mute + nav + back)</li><li>Login SSH, enter command 'killall headunit'</li></ol></p><hr><p><h3>Want to run tweaks from an SD card?</h3>With autorun script installed copy tweak files to an SD card.  Rename \"tweaks.sh\" to \"run.sh\".  Boot up the system and tweaks will run as expected.  NOTE: I/O to SD card is slower than USB so installation will take longer.</p>",

		"q1": "Is AIO compatible with my FW version?",
		"a1": "All compatible FW versions are listed in the 'Tweaking > Compatible Firmware Versions' section to the left in this help panel.  MZD-AIO-TI will read out your FW version at beginning of installation and show if it’s not compatible (or not yet tested) and you will abort the installation at this point, for Safety.",
		"q2": "How long does it take till the installation starts?",
		"a2": "Typically installation will start within 30 seconds to 2 minutes but it can take up to 10 minutes to begin.",
		"q3": "If something goes wrong, how can I help you to help me?",
		"a3": "During installation/uninstallation, a log file is created (AIO log.txt & MZD-AIO-TI info.txt) and some additional files will be copied on the USB drive.  Please make a ZIP file of them (complete root of USB drive) and send that to me or upload it somewhere (e.g. google drive or so) and send me the link.  Or you can download <a href='' onclick='externalLink(`thislink`)'>this tweak</a> that will copy some files from your MZD system to the USB drive and send those.",
		"q4": "Do I have to uninstall a tweak with AIO 1.x before installing it again?",
		"a4": "No, You can install every tweak with AIO, you never have to uninstall before. MZD-AIO-TI 2.x use the same tweaks AIO 1.x and compatibility was taken into consideration.",
		"q5": "How long does the installation/uninstallation take?",
		"a5": "Up to 10 minutes if every tweak has been selected (especially custom colors and speedcam-patch). performing a backup of your JCI folder can also take up to 10 minutes by itself so with everything up to 20 minutes.",
		"q6": "What if I want to revert my system but I forgot the tweaks I've installed?",
		"a6": "Uninstalling tweaks is safe in general, <s>if the uninstaller does not find a backup, it will copy the original files from USB drive over your original files of your MZD system BUT: YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS FOR NEW AND UNKNOWN FW VERSIONS! See: 'Reverting' section of this help panel.</s>",
		"q7": "I want to change the order of the audio sources?",
		"a7": "Edit: /jci/gui/apps/system/js/systemApp.js on lines 624 - 637<br><br><b>* Be careful, the last line must not end with a comma, or you run in to boot loop! *</b><br> I am working on modifying the tweak to give the option to make your own order without manually modifying any files.",
		"q8": "Can I install AIO from an SD card?",
		"a8": "No. SD card slot in the car is ONLY for satnav maps. You need to use USB port in the car, so either USB stick or USB-SD card reader with your card in it.",
		"q9": "How do I a reboot the MZD system? ",
		"a9": "Press NAV+MUTE for 10 seconds.",
		"q10": "Can you write this or that tweak for us?",
		"a10": "I have improved on many of the existing tweaks and tweaks.sh as a whole but I do have a job and Developing the GUI for this app is a pretty hefty task. That being said, I do have ideas for future tweaks and I will take suggestions but no promises. You can contact me with the contact form on the bottom right of the app."
